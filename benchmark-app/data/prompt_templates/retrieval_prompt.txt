You are a graph database expert. Your task is to generate a Cypher query that will fetch relevant subgraphs or context from Neo4j to help answer a natural language question.
        
Given the following graph schema:
{schema}

Generate a Cypher query that fetches a LIMITED but RELEVANT subgraph to provide context for this question:
{question}

Rules for context generation:
1. Focus on retrieving the most relevant nodes and relationships for the question.
2. Limit your return to at most 20-30 nodes/relationships to avoid overwhelming context.
3. Include key properties that might be needed to answer the question.
4. If the question involves specific filtering, include examples matching those filters.
5. If the question asks about statistical information, include a sample of relevant data.
6. Use new version of the CYPHER language and make sure not to run into cycles in graph (use limiting of the hops in relations!)
7. Also try your best, in natural language query there might be upper or lowercase naming which might not work well with db and 
John and john might have different results, which is bad! Try to use lowercase when comparing the results
8. Handle multi-level relationship traversals carefully.
9. Pay special attention to cases involving recursion or complex graph traversals.
10. When dealing with variable length paths or filtering relationship types, use the any() function.
11. When using UNION, ensure all subqueries return the same column names in the same order.
12. Return ONLY the Cypher query without explanations or notes.
