## üìã Overview

Text2Cypher is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess Claude Opus 4.0's capabilities in translating natural language queries to Neo4j Cypher queries. This bachelor thesis project evaluates the model's performance across 100 carefully crafted test cases, examining both retrieval-augmented and non-retrieval approaches.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Interactive dashboard with detailed analytics and visualizations
- Export capabilities for CSV and Markdown reports

**Technologies:** Streamlit, Anthropic API, Neo4j, Plotly, Pandas

### üóÑÔ∏è **Data Generator** (`app-data-generator/`)

Creates realistic graph data for testing and evaluation scenarios.

**Key Features:**

- Generates multi-generational family trees with complex relationships
- Creates educational and professional networks
- Produces location-based data with geographical relationships
- Supports both simple and detailed schema configurations
- Exports Neo4j database dumps for consistent testing

**Technologies:** Faker, Neo4j, Python

### üîç **Interactive RAG** (`app-interactive-rag/`)

Interactive tool for testing retrieval-augmented generation with real-time feedback.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time Cypher query generation from natural language
- Schema-aware query construction
- Context retrieval and visualization
- Query history logging and analysis
- Support for custom schema configurations

**Technologies:** Streamlit, LangChain, Google Generative AI, Neo4j

### üìù **Test Case Manager** (`app-test-case-manager/`)

Web-based interface for creating, managing, and organizing test cases.

**Key Features:**

- Intuitive form-based test case creation
- Category and difficulty classification
- JSON-based expected results validation
- Bulk test case management and editing
- Export capabilities for test case collections

**Technologies:** Streamlit, JSON

## üìà Evaluation Results

The framework has generated comprehensive evaluation results stored in the `Results/` directory:

### Simple Schema Results

- **Simple-No-Retrieval.csv/md** - Baseline performance without retrieval
- **Simple-Retrieval.csv/md** - Performance with retrieval augmentation

### Detailed Schema Results

- **Detailed-No-Retrieval.csv/md** - Complex schema without retrieval
- **Detailed-Retrieval.csv/md** - Complex schema with retrieval augmentation

Each result file contains:

- Individual test case performance metrics
- Overall accuracy statistics
- Token usage analysis
- Execution success rates
- Detailed error categorization
